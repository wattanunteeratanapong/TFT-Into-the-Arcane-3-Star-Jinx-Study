## Overview & Control Variable
TFT is a game that heavily rely on a probability and statistic, In this repository we are gonna find out that how many gold do we need to spare for reroll to find 3-Star Jinx, this could also apply to every 5-Costs unit not only Jinx. <br><br>
If you can make 5-Cost Unit that have 3-Star, in that match it's a guarantee win at 1st place for you in that match. <br>
So that we can use this info to make the best decision for the best strategy and getting out of this elo hell. <br><br>
In this experiment we're gonna test how much gold to get 5-Cost 3-Star Unit on level 7-10, and experiment we gonna test on patch 14.23 where 6-Cost doesn't exist in this patch. 
But this test could also apply to patch 14.24 because 6-Cost chance are very low it doesn't affect the chance of 5-Cost units. <br><br>
And this experiment test only 1 player in real match other player can reduce the amount of 5-Cost Unit in the pool make it slightly easier to find 5-Cost Unit that we're looking for. 
And also this simulation didn't use special technique like picking same cost out of the pool, in real game player could apply this technique to make it easier to find unit that we want. 
And in the real game there are many factor that can increase a chance of getting 3-Star Jinx like champion duplicator, augment, selecting circle stage, etc. <br>
<br>



## Pool System
There are 5 type of unit in TFT. 1-Cost, 2-Cost, 3-Cost, 4-Cost, 5-Cost <br>
1-Cost Unit each champion have 30 unit in the pool <br>
2-Cost Unit each champion have 25 unit in the pool <br>
3-Cost Unit each champion have 18 unit in the pool <br>
4-Cost Unit each champion have 10 unit in the pool <br>
5-Cost Unit each champion have 9 unit in the pool <br>
If each champion is running out of pool, player won't be able to find that unit unless that unit is sold back to the pool <br><br>
1-Cost(14) : Amumu, Darius, Draven, Irelia, Lux, Maddie, Morgana, Powder, Singed, Steb, Trundle, Vex, Violet, Zyra <br>
2-Cost(13) : Akali, Camille, Leona, Nocturne, Rell, Renata, Sett, Tristana, Urgot, Vander, Vladimir, Zeri, Ziggs <br>
3-Cost(13) : Blitzcrank, Cassiopeia, Ezreal, Gangplank, Kogmaw, Loris, Nami, Nunu, Renni, Scar, Smeech, Swain, Twisted Fate <br>
4-Cost(12) : Ambessa, Corki, Dr Mundo, Ekko, Elise, Garen, Heimerdinger, Illaoi, Silco, Twitch, Vi, Zoe <br>

<br>



## Unit System 
Every unit at every cost could upgrade to 1-Star, 2-Star, 3-Star. <br>
1-Star is a unit that can find the the pool <br>
2-Star is a combined of 1-Star 3 unit <br>
3-Star is a combined of 2-Star 3 unit (1-Star 9 unit) <br>

<br>



## Level System & Odds System
Chance of getting each cost in each level is different <br>
As we can see 5-Cost Unite start to appear in the shop at level 7, so in this experiment we're gonna test from level 7 to 10, to see each level gold needed for finding 5-Cost 3-Star Unit <br>

</div>
<br>



## Shop System
Each reroll player have 5 slot of random unit, player can buy unit from this shop, this mean in 1 reroll player have 5 times chance to get Jinx.

## Conclusion
From simulation roll for 3-Star Jinx without reaching level 10 is a very bold move, It is almost impossible to find 3-Star Jinx without level 10. <br>
### Conditon to pull 3-Star Jinx off
<ul>
  <li> You must reach level 10 </li>
  <li> You gonna need to find at least 2-3 Jinx from "Champion Duplicator" or "Augment" or "Selecting Circle"</li>
  <li> Sell you whole board for gold to reroll for 3-Star Jinx, you gonna need to reroll around 50 times. </li>
</ul>
If you met these condition you most likely to get 3-Star Jinx. Keep that in mind in real game scenerio there are many factor like player that buy other 5-Cost and make Jinx easier to find. Or there are player that cut you off by buying 1 Jinx, then Jinx in the pool is not enough for your to build 3-Star Jinx <br><br>
